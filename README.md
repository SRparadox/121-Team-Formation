# Devlog Entry - [11/15]
## Introducing the team
- Tools Lead: Ezra Frary
- Engine Lead: Damon Phan
- Design Co-Leads: Anais Montes & Shazer Rizzo Varela

\* each role is expected to act as described on the Team Formation Document!

## Tools and materials
\- Primary engine : Our team will be completing this project in the latest version of **Unity** (2022.3.52f1). Every member in our team has experience working with Unity and prefers it greatly to frameworks like Phaser, so we felt it was the best choice for our group to be able to get things done quickly and collectively. [potentially add more about specific libraries here too]

\- Languages : Our project will primarily use **C#** for scripting in Unity, as it is the standard language supported by the engine, and likewise for Godot, we will use **GDScript**. [add info about data handling?]

\- Tools : We will be using **Visual Studio** or **VS Code** alongside the Unity Editor as our primary development tools. Since we are planning to have our game be 2D, we will be relying on tools such as **Photoshop**, **Procreate**, and **Aesprite**, to create assets for our game. Our team members are already familiar with using these programs, so they seem the obvious choice for us. 

\- Alternate Platform : We chose **Godot** as our alternate engine, primarily because it seems that a lot of Unity knowledge and design practices are transferable to working with Godot. Our Engine Lead also has substantial experience with this engine and should be able to help the rest of us orient ourselves in the alternate engine should that be necessary.  

## Outlook
Our team is hoping to find ways to approach the assignment requirements creatively and in a way that speaks to what we personally enjoy in games. While we aim to meet the technical and mechanical goals of this assignment, weâ€™d also like to work on something that expands them into a fulfilling experience and possesses some kind of narrative or theme. This additional element of storytelling is important to us, as it provides an opportunity to create something that feels distinctly ours among the work of our peers! Of course, the most difficult part about this is creating a balanced and satisfying player experience in the limited timeframe that we have to complete this game. Meaningfully incorporating some sort of narrative adds a layer of complexity to this project, and we already know that new requirements will be introduced during development, potentially forcing us to adapt and implement features in Unity or Godot. We also face the challenge of juggling this project alongside other game group projects from different classes, which limits how much time we can dedicate to iterating and polishing our work. Some aspects of development are likely to be tricky, but we will be learning new skills from each other and growing as developers along the way!
